//! Byte-opacity tripwire counters.
//!
//! The broker is a byte mover, not a byte interpreter. Two invariants
//! protect that:
//!
//! - **Record decode** — no code path may parse an individual record out of
//!   a RecordBatch. The closest the codec gets is the 61-byte header walker
//!   in [`crate::recordbatch_count`].
//! - **Batch re-encode** — no code path may rebuild a RecordBatch from
//!   decoded fields. Storage stores the wire bytes as-is; the response path
//!   emits them as-is.
//!
//! Either invariant being broken should fail loudly. These counters are the
//! pre-production trip mechanism: every offender calls
//! [`bump_codec_record_decode`] or [`bump_codec_batch_reencode`] with a
//! `site` string, and the integration tests in `crates/kaas-codec/tests/`
//! assert both counters read zero at the end of every run.
//!
//! In Phase 1 these are atomic counters. Phase 8 swaps them for OTLP
//! metric instruments behind the same function signature so production
//! alerts can fire on `kaas_codec_record_decode_total{site=...}` and
//! `kaas_codec_batch_reencode_total{site=...}`.
